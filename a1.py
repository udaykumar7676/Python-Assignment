# Arithmetic Operators
# Write a Python program to perform the following operations:
# 1. Add, subtract, multiply, and divide two numbers (input by the user).
# 2. Use the modulus operator to find the remainder of their division.
# 3. Use the exponentiation operator to raise the first number to the power of the second
# number.
# 4. Perform floor division on the two numbers

# We are taking The First Number as User input from the user
a = int(input("Enter First Number : ")) 
# We are taking The Second Number as User input from the user
b = int(input("Enter Second Number : ")) 
#Here we are adding a+b
c = a+b 
#Here we are Subtracting a-b
d = a-b 
#Here we are Multiplicating a*b
e = a*b 
#Here we are floor Dividing a//b
f = a//b 
#Here we are finding remainder a%b
g = a%b 
#Here we are dividing a/b
h = a/b 
#Here we are finding exponential a*b
i = a*b
